# wet_lab
A repository for wet lab protocols.

## Info

I developed or optimised these protocols from existing ones (please refer to each individual protocol for more information) while working in the Laura Ross (http://lauraross.bio.ed.ac.uk) & Konrad Lohse (https://sites.google.com/view/lohselab) research groups (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, The University of Edinburgh).

If you would like to use any of the protocols found here, please cite this repository.
