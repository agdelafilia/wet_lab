# RNA extraction protocol with isopropanol and chloroform (2.5:1) 

## Information
This is the Ross lab protocol for total RNA extraction without a commercial kit. For sample homogenisation, refer to the RNA extraction protocol with the PureLink kit. The protocol is scaled for samples homogenised in 1 ml of Trizol.

## General advice
-	Always use gloves.
-	Before starting, clean workspace (bench surface, ice bucket) and pipettes with 70% EtOH and RNaseZap.
-	To maximise RNA yield and avoid contamination, use LoBind tubes and filter tips only.
-	__Trizol is extremely hazardous__. Work under the fume hood until the first centrifugation step and avoid exposing naked skin (e.g. wrists) to splashes and drops.
-	Before starting, clean workspace (bench surface, ice bucket) and pipettes with 70% EtOH and RNaseZap.
-	To maximise RNA yield and avoid contamination, use LoBind tubes and filter tips only.
-	Micropestles should be handled with care to avoid sample contamination. Do not let micropestle tips touch anything (e.g. ice, surfaces, skin) but the sample. Always use a clean (i.e. autoclaved) micropestle for each sample. Keep micropestles in racks, tip-side up.
-	Always spin down tubes on a microfuge before opening.

## Workflow

1.	Add 200 μL chloroform. Shake by hand for 15 sec, incubate at room temp for __exactly__ 3 min.

2.	Centrifuge at 4°C, 15 min, top speed.

3.	Remove upper aqueous phase (approx. 600 µl) to new low-bind DNA tube.

4.	Discard lower phase appropriately.
    * for small samples, if might be necessary to pipette as much of the upper aqueous phase as possible, which can result in Trizol traces being carried on. If this happens, add one volume of chloroform, shake by hand, and repeat steps 2 to 4. 
    * this step can be repeated if the interphase still seems cloudy, or if one has accidentally pipetted into the organic phase. 
    
5.	Add 1 μL glycogen/linear acrylamide as a carrier and 500 μL isopropanol.

6.	Mix and incubate at -20°C overnight (or 1 hour at -80°C).

7.	Centrifuge at 4°C, 15 min, top speed. If samples are small, a very small RNA pellet is to be expected.

8.	Remove supernatant and add 1 mL, 70% EtOH. Invert a few times and centrifuge at 4°C, 5-10 min, top speed.

9.	Remove supernatant, spin briefly, carefully remove the rest of the liquid.

10.	Air dry for 5 min max at room temp. __Do not overdry!__

11.	Resuspend in desired volume of nuclease-free water.

12.	Store at -80°C.

13.	Post extraction (optional):
    * residual gDNA digestion: we use Thermo Scientific's DNAse I with RNasin as a RNAse inhibitor (0.25 ul per 10ul of reaction, 1U/ul)
    * RNA cleanup: we use RNA Clean & Concentrator™-5 (Zymo)
