# gDNA extraction protocol

## Information
A protocol for high-yield, HMW (>40-50 Kbp) gDNA extraction developed by Andrés G. de la Filia in the Konrad Lohse lab (IEB, The University of Edinburgh). This protocol was adapted from a previous version developed by Dominik Laetsch, the 10x Genomics Sample Preparation Demonstrated Protocol and the MagAttract HMW DNA Kit handbook. It was developed for single butterflies but has been successfully used for insect pools (mealybigs, flies) and mammalian tissue (mouse, toad, fish)

## Reagents and consumables
- LoBind 1.5 ml tubes and filter tips (including low binding 200µl filter tips).
- Autoclaved micropestles for 1.5 ml tubes.
- Qiagen Cell Lysis Buffer.
- Proteinase K (20 mg/ml).
- Qiagen Protein Precipitation Buffer.
- RNAse A (100 mg/ml).
- Isopropanol (molecular biology grade).
- 70% ethanol (freshly made on the day, molecular biology grade).
- H<sub>2</sub>O (molecular biology grade, RNase and DNase free)
- Liquid nitrogen, dry ice, ice, centrifuge, shaking heat block, tweezers, sterile razor blades.

## General advice
-	Always use gloves.
-	Before starting, clean workspace (bench surface, ice bucket) and pipettes with 70% EtOH and DNAZap.
-	To maximise DNA yield and avoid contamination, use LoBind tubes and filter tips only.
-	Micropestles should be handled with care to avoid sample contamination. Do not let micropestle tips touch anything (e.g. ice, surfaces, skin) but the sample. Always use a clean (i.e. autoclaved) micropestle for each sample. Keep micropestles in racks, tip-side up.
-	To minimise DNA shearing, pipette slowly. Follow the 5s rule (5s to load tip, 5s to discharge).
-	Mix by inversion = invert tube at least 10 times (25 for thorough mixing). As a general rule, do not mix by vortexing, as it will shear DNA. Gentle vortexing at low speeds, however, will not adversely affect DNA integrity during sample lysis (but absolutely no vortexing from Part 2 onwards).
-	Always spin down tubes on a microfuge before opening.
-	Heating blocks are not to be trusted. Always confirm that the heat block has actually reached set temperature with a thermometer and adjust accordingly.
-	13,300 rpm = 17,000 g

## Protocol

### Part 1: Sample lysis and protein digestion

1.	Recover sample tubes from the freezer and transfer them to dry ice. Keep samples on dry ice when possible until addition of Cell Lysis Buffer.

2.	Flick sample tubes so that material is not located at the bottom of the tube.
    *	Micropestles may not reach the bottom.
    *	More force can be applied if material is on the side of the tube.
    
3.	Crush material using a micropestle (up to 10 up-and-down pushes). Moderate twisting may be used, but up-and-down pushes are always preferable. Depending on sample material, proceed as follows:
  * 3a. For soft material: open sample tubes and add 500µl of Cell Lysis Buffer. Gently crush submerged tissue.
  * 3b. For harder material: submerge sample tubes in liquid nitrogen and gently crush dry material into smaller pieces until tissue defrosts. If needed, tubes may be closed and submerged in liquid nitrogen again for repeated crushing. Once tissue has been broken into small pieces, add 500µl of Cell Lysis Buffer and proceed as in 3a.
  * 3c. For butterflies (and other big samples): too much starting tissue will adversely affect sample lysis efficiency and eventually result in reduced DNA yield. Therefore, to extract DNA from individual butterflies, it is advisable to cut individuals into smaller pieces and process them separately. To do so, submerge sample tubes in liquid nitrogen, take out the specimen with tweezers, place it on a sterile razor blade and cut it into smaller pieces with a second blade (rule of thumb: divide thorax into 2-4 pieces and abdomen, longitudinally, into 2 pieces. Unless absolutely necessary to maximise DNA yield, heads should be avoided due to their high pigment content). Transfer each piece to a new Eppendorf tube and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen; then proceed as in 3b. Process all tubes in parallel until Part 3, step 1c.
  
4.	Add >=100µl of Cell Lysis Buffer to wash remains of tissue from the tip of the micropestle. A pipette tip may also be used to manually remaining transfer material from the micropestle tip into the buffer.
    *	Total volume should be at least 600µl. An excess of starting material may result in a highly viscous solution, which will reduce the efficiency of proteinase K digestion. If so, increase volume of Cell Lysis Buffer _(note: in subsequent steps, reagent volumes are given for 600µl of Cell Lysis Buffer. Volumes indicated with an asterisk should be adjusted if more Cell Lysis Buffer is added)._ Recommended maximum volume is 900µl, in order to avoid exceeding maximum volume of 1.5ml tubes after adding subsequent reagents.
    
5.	Add 20µl* of proteinase K and thoroughly mix by inversion. Quickly spin down on microfuge.
6.	Incubate samples @ 56°C overnight (12-16h), shaking at 750-900rpm.
    *	Shaking at these speeds during sample lysis will not affect DNA integrity. Alternatively, if no shaking heat block is available, tubes should be inverted/very gently and briefly vortexed whenever possible to disperse tissue (at least once every 20 min during the first 2h).
