# RNA extraction protocol with the PureLink kit

## Information
A protocol for total RNA extraction developed by Andrés G. de la Filia in the Laura Ross lab (IEB, The University of Edinburgh). This protocol was adapted from a modified version of the PureLink RNA purification kit (Thermo Fisher) used in the John Clark lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

## Reagents and consumables
- LoBind 1.5 ml tubes and filter tips (including low binding 200µl filter tips).
- Autoclaved micropestles for 1.5 ml tubes.
- Trizol
- PureLink RNA purification kit + DNase mix
- Chloroform
- 70% ethanol (freshly made on the day, molecular biology grade)
- H<sub>2</sub>O (molecular biology grade, RNase and DNase free)
- Liquid nitrogen, dry ice, ice, tweezers, sterile razor blades
- Two centrifuges (one cooled to 4°C, another one at RT)

## General advice
-	Always use gloves.
-	Before starting, clean workspace (bench surface, ice bucket) and pipettes with 70% EtOH and RNaseZap.
-	To maximise RNA yield and avoid contamination, use LoBind tubes and filter tips only.
-	__Trizol is extremely hazardous__. Work under the fume hood until the first centrifugation step and avoid exposing naked skin (e.g. wrists) to splashes and drops.
-	Before starting, clean workspace (bench surface, ice bucket) and pipettes with 70% EtOH and RNaseZap.
-	To maximise RNA yield and avoid contamination, use LoBind tubes and filter tips only.
-	Micropestles should be handled with care to avoid sample contamination. Do not let micropestle tips touch anything (e.g. ice, surfaces, skin) but the sample. Always use a clean (i.e. autoclaved) micropestle for each sample. Keep micropestles in racks, tip-side up.
-	Always spin down tubes on a microfuge before opening.

## Workflow

### Part 0: Preparing DNase mix

Per sample:
  * 10X DNase I reaction buffer - 8ul
  * Resuspended DNase I - 10ul
  * RNase-free water - 62ul
  * Total - 80ul

Prepare mix during first centrifugation step and keep on ice.

### Part 1: Sample homogenization

1.	Recover sample tubes from the -80°C freezer and transfer them to dry ice. If working with fresh samples, place them directly in an Eppendorf tube.

2.	Submerge sample tubes in liquid nitrogen. If working with large individuals, place samples on a sterile razor blade and cut them in small pieces using a second blade.

3. Add 500-800ul of Trizol to the sample tube.
    *	Adding more than 500ul can cause spills when grinding. Depending on sample size, add only 300-400ul of Trizol to grind and top up once tissue is sufficiently lysed.
    *	If processing multiple samples, keep flash frozen material on dry ice until Trizol addition to avoid RNA degradation at RT.
  
4.	Crush tissue thoroughly using a clean micropestle and a rotor.

5.	Continue or store (-80°C).

### Part 2: Phase separation

1.	Incubate tubes 1-5min on ice.

2.	Add RT chloroform (1/5 volume of TRIzol – e.g. 100ul for 500ul)

3.	Shake by hand for 15s and incubate for __exactly__ 3min at RT.

4.	Centrifuge at 12,000g for 15min at 4°C. 

5.	Transfer supernatant to a new tube at RT, add an equal volume of freshly prepared 70% EtOH and mix by vortexing. Invert the tube to disperse precipitate.

### Part 3: DNA digestion and washing

1.	Transfer up to 700ul of sample to a PureLink spin cartridge and centrifuge at 12,000g for 15s at RT

2.	Discard flow-through and repeat if necessary.

3.	Add 350ul of Wash Buffer I and centrifuge at 12,000g for 15s at RT.

4.	Add 80ul of DNAse mix onto the membrane and incubate for 15min at RT.

5.	Add 350ul of Wash Buffer I and centrifuge at 12,000g for 15s at RT.

6.	Place the spin cartridge into a new collection tube, add 500ul of Wash Buffer II and centrifuge at 12,000g for 15s at RT. Repeat this step once.

### Part 4: Elution

1.	Centrifuge at 12,000g for 1min to dry the membrane.

2.	Discard collection tube and place the spin cartridge into an Eppendorf tube.

3.	Add >35ul of RNase-free water and incubate for 1min.

4.	Centrifuge for 2 min at >12,000g at RT.

5.	Repeat elution at least once (depending on intended volume) from step 3.

6.	Quantify RNA (Qubit) and check absorbance ratios (Nanodrop) and DNA integrity (Bioanalyzer / 2% agarose gel).
